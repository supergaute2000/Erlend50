# Bror 50 - The Game: Implementation Plan

## Overview
A simplified retro-style shoot-em-up game celebrating Bror's 50th birthday. This implementation plan focuses on creating a playable game that can be completed in time for the party, using simple graphics and mechanics while still capturing the essence of Bror's life journey.

## Technical Approach

### Graphics
- Use simple geometric shapes and limited color palettes (8-16 colors per level)
- Create basic sprite templates that can be reused with color variations
- Utilize Phaser's built-in graphics capabilities for simple shapes
- Consider using free 8-bit asset packs for common elements (bullets, explosions)
- Focus on readability and clear visual distinction between game elements

### Game Mechanics
- Implement a simplified version of the 1942-style gameplay
- Use basic collision detection and physics
- Create a limited set of power-ups (3-4 types) that work across all levels
- Design simple enemy patterns that are easy to implement
- Focus on making the core gameplay fun rather than complex features

### Mobile Optimization
- Ensure the game runs at 60fps on most mobile devices
- Use sprite pooling to minimize garbage collection
- Implement touch controls that are responsive and intuitive
- Test on multiple device sizes and adjust UI accordingly

## Simplified Game Structure

### Core Gameplay
- Player controls a simple ship/vehicle that can move in all directions
- Shoot enemies by tapping/clicking
- Collect power-ups to enhance abilities
- Progress through levels by defeating enemies and bosses
- Answer quiz questions between levels to earn bonus points
