### Background Implementation Notes
1. Each background should be split into three distinct layers for parallax scrolling
2. Layers should be designed to loop seamlessly when scrolling vertically
3. Each layer should be 800x800 pixels to allow for smooth looping
4. The total background height (2400 pixels) allows for three full screen heights of content
5. Consider adding subtle animation elements to each layer (moving clouds, waves, etc.)
6. Ensure sufficient contrast between layers to maintain readability
7. Keep the foreground layer simple to avoid visual clutter during gameplay

## Notes for Asset Generation

1. All assets should follow a consistent 8-bit/pixel art style
2. Use a limited color palette (8-16 colors per asset)
3. Maintain transparency where needed (especially for sprites)
4. Keep designs simple and readable at small sizes
5. Ensure all assets are optimized for web use
6. Test assets against different background colors
7. Maintain consistent style across all game elements

## Asset Organization

Place all generated assets in their respective directories:
- `/assets/images/characters/` - For player and boss characters
- `/assets/images/backgrounds/` - For level backgrounds
- `/assets/images/ui/` - For UI elements
- `/assets/images/items/` - For power-ups and collectibles
